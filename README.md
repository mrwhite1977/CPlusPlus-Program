# CPlusPlus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was about building a compounding interest calculator that was to teach local high school students about investing as well as the power of compounding interest.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt the program was responsive and maintained an easy to use interface to facilitate the learning of the key elements of investing.  The program should be accessible enough for not just the intended audience but the average user.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I would like to work on the Reports Generator section of the code to clean up the look to enhance the user experience.  I would like to look at ways to streamline the Reports code to help future coders working on this project be able to make necessary upgrades/enhancements.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The Data Input section provided me with the biggest challenge.  Make sure I was able to provide an interface to work in while building effective error handling.  I looked to style guides online including cplusplus.com and stackoverflow for examples to help me craft the code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Building the calculations code will be something I can use again to help creating future code.  Also, working on creating a pleasant and inviting interface that is not only fuctional but aesthetically pleasing is a constant challenge but one I think can be built upon in the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The challenge was to be able to create code that functioned but was not overwritten.  I worked to find ways to simplify what I was trying to accomplish.  I would write the code, test it, and then perform adjustments to find cleaner ways to perform the same tasks.  It was an ongoing process and one that I can/will work on.
